# Rental-Car-profit-in-Excel-Capstone-Project-
How do we increase the profit of a rental car company? Which changes illicit the greatest increase in profit?  I evaluted three different methods for increasing profit including selling vehicles, adding branches, and replacing vehicles to maximize profit.   Using vlookup, conditional formatting, and creating charts in Excel, I evaluated and analyzed a publicly available data set for a ficitonal rental car company called Lariat.  I created a dashboard for executives and branch managers to evaluate the performance of the individual fleet vehicles compared to the overall fleet performance.  I also made revenue comparisons based on fleet managment methods and depicted them in graphs using Excel.  This project was completed as a Capstone Project for coursework in PowerPoint and presented to my mentor.
