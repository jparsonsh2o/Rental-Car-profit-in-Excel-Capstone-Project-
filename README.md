# Rental-Car-profit-in-Excel-Capstone-Project-
Using Excel and PowerPoint, this project evaluated and analyzed a publicly available data set for a ficitonal rental car company called Lariat.  I created a dashboard for executives and branch managers to evaluate the performance of the individual fleet vehicles compared to the overall fleet performance.  I also made revenue comparisons based on fleet managment methods and depicted them in graphs.  This project was completed as a Capstone Project for coursework in PowerPoint.
